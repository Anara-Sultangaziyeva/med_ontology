The file MedicalGeneticOntology_with_DataProperties.owl is an ontology developed in the OWL (Web Ontology Language) format for a formalized description of entities and relationships in the field of medical genetics. The ontology reflects the key concepts used in the interpretation of genetic data in clinical practice and is intended for use in the tasks of semantic annotation, automated analysis, knowledge extraction and integration with biomedical information systems.

The ontology structure includes basic classes such as Gene (gene), Variant (genetic variant), Disease (disease), Significance (clinical significance), InheritancePattern (type of inheritance), Phenotype (phenotype), Symptom (symptom), AgeOfOnset (age of onset) and Recommendation (clinical recommendation). To describe the relationships between these entities, object properties are set, including hasGene (a variant is localized in a gene), associatedWithDisease (a variant is associated with a disease), hasSignificance (a variant has significance), hasInheritance (a disease or variant has a type of inheritance), hasPhenotype (a disease is manifested by a phenotype), as well as hasSymptom, hasOnset, and others. Additionally, attribute properties (data properties) are implemented that allow you to set specific values, such as hasHGVSNotation (HGVS mutation notation), hasChromosomeLocation (genomic coordinates), hasOMIMLink (link to OMIM record), hasProteinChange (change at the protein level).

The ontology may contain specific individuals (instances) demonstrating real clinical and genetic scenarios: for example, c.144dupC mutations, BRCA1 and CFTR genes, Gitelman syndrome and Menke-Hennekam syndrome 2 diseases. This structure provides the ability to build SPARQL queries, automatic classification, semantic search, and integration with text data marked up in systems such as Label Studio. The ontology is applicable in decision support tasks, building expert systems, as well as for annotating and analyzing data obtained as a result of exomic or genomic sequencing.
